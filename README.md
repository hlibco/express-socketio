# Express and Socket.io

[![Standard - JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](http://standardjs.com/)
---

This is the first attempt to dispatch random events to the browser using Socket.io on every 3 seconds. It also allows the user to request the service date/time and handles the response.

After understanding the mechanism, a possible use case is to *notify* the user when some DB record has been changed and he/she has to refresh the page in order to get the most up-to-date data.


## Use
---

Install dependencies:
`yarn` or `npm install`

Run the project:
